# My Experience :-

###### Day 1:-
My day started at 7:00 A.M. I woke up in the morning and thanked God for the day, praying for an exciting day ahead. I come from Bathinda, which is why I am living in a hostel here. I reached the mess around 8:10 A.M. and had my breakfast. I arrived at Gurudwara Sahib around 9:00 A.M. After that, I sat down fully relaxed and listened to kirtan.

After Ardas, we had a short tea break. Afterward, we all went to the college auditorium for our inaugural class. We waited there for a while before our class started with the inspiring words of **Harpreet Maam**. I felt the warmth of a mother in her words. Then our Principal motivated us to make the most of this platform and become very successful in our lives.

Then our first guest of honour, the PCS officer in a very impressing way teaches us the lesson how to grab a opportunity.He took a 500 rupees note and asked if anyone wants that 500 rupees, I thought that time to take but i thought he is going to make me a example of greedy person but then one boy stood up and took that note then he told us that was an opportunity which that boy grabed. I learned from him that day is,“Don’t wait for opportunities; seize the opportunities that come to you”.

Then our second guest of honor, the ADGP officer, shared many valuable stories about how God rewards our good deeds and punishes us for our bad deeds. He told us how God tests us in many phases of our lives. He spoke for about an hour and a half without any preparation, which is incredible. He could speak for the whole day effortlessly; his speaking skills are incredible. In the end, I received countless lessons that will always help me in my life.

###### Day 2:-
On day 2 we had 2 classes in first class we were taught maths my neeraj kumar sir and after a short break our senior arranged a workshop where they taught us about canva which is graphic designing tool with which we can make logo's and poster and many more and at the end of the day we learned many great things and interacted with are senior's .
###### Day 3:-
Today we again went to the auditorium were we attend lecture of former principal **SB SINGH** were he asked us to write a page about are likes, dislikes and what we wanna do in our life which was a very interactive session and after that very respected **Dr. Harpal Singh Pannu** arrived in the auditorium .I didn't knew anything about him at all but he started speaking i was astonished by his way of telling story and his command in punjabi was marvelous and now i also have a spark to learn to write punjabi properly and read books written by him and I am really thankful to my college staff who arranged such a session with such a great man. 

###### Day 4:-
Today we had to reach ouside the auditorium by 9:00 A.M. because we had to a educational trip .I was really interested to go but when we arrived there the bus was late and there only half of my excitement vanished but after some time the bus arrived and we went to the trip but when we reached the venue I see a bsnl office which I was not expecting at all and when we saw it from inside it was like a jungle but a jungle of wire's. I was totally disappointed but at the end of the day even if was not that good but we learn something new and had a preview about the harsh reality .
